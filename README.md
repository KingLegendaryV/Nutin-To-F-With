`Project: Wu Tang Name Generator`

THE RZA, THE GZA, OLD DIRTY BASTARD,
RAEKWON THE CHEF, GHOSTFACE KILLAH, INSPECKTAH DECK, U GOD, MASTA KILLAH AND M.E.T.H.O.D.  MAN


If the Wu Tang Clan were vowels Redman would be Y, but I digress.  If you're reading this you probably dont call yourself LEGENDARY V (I walk away from readmes like a baby bird does a nest) so you dont have the chops to make a better rap name than a member of the Wu Tang Clan.  The only rappers I can think of with names on the same level as the members of the Wu are Count Bass D and MF DOOM.  I would add Earl Sweatshirt to that list but James Pants came first and I know dude watched Adult Swim when I did but I DIGRESS.  If youre reading this you've stumbled upon something that you desperately need in your life: my guidance into helping you craft your rap name.  


Now I know that intro was a lot, but lets get into what this is.  This is me elevating one of those lame ass internet surveys that'll tell you what harry potter character you'd most resemble when you hula (you thought it was spelled hoola) hoop to a level of godliness.  This is a list of questions that you'll answer with your animal instincts in order to discover your inner greatness.  This isnt just a survey, this is the digital awakening thats going to make you quit coding and discover yourself in bars.  This is the red pill.  Take this test at your own risk, and only try it if youre committed to abandoning your terrible name and ready to live in your truth.  This is a rap name generator that I like to call

This project is really a simple finesse.  You pick an answer and each answer has a value and string assigned to it.  Your final answer is the accumulation of the the hidden values

This project is a cute exercise and all that, but if you really need a rap/artist name hit me up.  It'll take at least two to six weeks of training and bonding for me to give you the perfect name that fits your personality, but I'll surely bless your life with your true identity
